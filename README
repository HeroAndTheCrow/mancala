well hey there! lookit that. Somebody looked at Mancala.

I decided to make mancala in python one day, and then I proceeded to make Python.

It's certainly not perfect, it has a whole lot of breaks where I don't think there should be

but it is functional! And that's a plus

I hope you enjoy, I probably should add multiplayer at some point.
